# ColorPicker-in-Reactjs

Learning the very popular and powerful framework-- REACT-- from CodeAcademy. My first Capstone project.
In this project, I built a program that helps designers think of new color schemes.
The program will set the screen's background to a random color. Clicking a button will refresh to a new, random color.
Random generators are a well-known tool for breaking a creative rut.
